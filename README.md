# Project 3: Spots

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!


#  Spots - Responsive Webpage (Stage 2)

Spots — Responsive Webpage (Stage 2)

## Project Description

This project is a responsive webpage for Spots, a simple image-sharing application. The goal of this stage is to build a layout that adapts smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using the design provided in Figma.

### The Page Features:

* A responsive header with a logo and navigation buttons
* A profile section containing user information
* A dynamic grid of image cards that reorganizes itself depending on screen size
* Text overflow protection so long captions or profile descriptions are displayed cleanly
* Hover effects for interactive elements
* A footer that remains visually consistent across all breakpoints

This stage focuses on layout, structure, responsiveness, and styling, preparing the page for later interactive JavaScript features.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

This project was built using modern, standards-based web tools:

- HTML5 — semantic structure for the profile, header, footer, and card grid

- CSS3 — styling and responsive behavior

- CSS Grid — used for the card layout (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)

- Flexbox — used for the header, footer, and profile sections

- Media Queries — to switch layouts for intermediate resolutions and mobile screens

- Responsive Units (%, fr, max-width, auto) — minimizing fixed pixel values

- Text Overflow Techniques
    * Single-line truncation with ellipses
    * Multi-line clamping for profile text

- BEM Methodology — for clear, maintainable CSS class naming
